# Adding BIOS files

BIOS files are files required for some emulators to operate correctly.&#x20;

### Location

For most systems, BIOS files must be placed in the `\bios` folder in your Retrobat installation:

</div>

{% hint style="info" %}
A few systems need the bios files to be placed in subfolders or in other paces. Refer to the individual system wiki page for detailed information about BIOS placement.
{% endhint %}

### Missing BIOS check

From the [GAME SETTINGS](../navigation/main-menu.md#game-settings) in the [MAIN MENU](../navigation/main-menu.md), you have the possibility to perform a check for missing BIOS:

The missing BIOS appear with a broken chain icon. The ones where the md5 hash is not listed by Retrobat will appear with a ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png>) icon.

The detailed list of required BIOS for each system can be found in the individual [Game System section of the wiki](../systems-and-emulators/supported-game-systems/).

{% hint style="warning" %}
BIOS files are copyrighted and are therefore not included with Retrobat.&#x20;

We can not legally distribute them, so you will need to supply your own.
