# Adding BIOS files

Some emulators require BIOS files to work correctly.&#x20;

### Location

As a general rule, BIOS files must be copied to the `\bios` subfolder of the Retrobat folder:

{% hint style="info" %}
Some systems need the bios files to be placed in subfolders or in other places. Refer to the individual system wiki page for detailed information about BIOS placement.
{% endhint %}

### Missing BIOS check

RetroBat has a "missing bios check" function available from the [GAME SETTINGS](../navigation/main-menu.md#game-settings) in the [MAIN MENU](../navigation/main-menu.md):

The missing BIOS appear with a broken chain icon. The ones where the md5 hash is not listed by Retrobat will appear with a ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>) icon, however the latter still can work.

{% hint style="info" %}
The detailed list of required BIOS for each system can be found in the individual [Game System section of the wiki](../systems-and-emulators/supported-game-systems/).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
BIOS files are copyrighted and are therefore not included with Retrobat.&#x20;

The team can not legally distribute them, so you will need to dump them from the original hardware.
