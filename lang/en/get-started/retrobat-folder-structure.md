</div>

{% hint style="info" %}
RetroBat configuration files (es\_systems.cfg, es\_input.cfg, ...) as well as program logs are located in this folder and its subfolders.
{% endhint %}

### .emulationstation subfolder

#### collections

Here you will find the file created by ES when you create an [editable game collection](https://wiki.retrobat.org/navigation/game-collections#editable-game-collections). This file, named as the collection created, with a `.cfg` extension, contains the differents games of the created collection, with their paths.

#### music

RetroBat allow the use of `.mp3` ,`.ogg` ,`.wav`and `.flac` audio files, and also some others less used format.\
A song can be skipped by pushing the left stick`[L3]`button, or from the Quick Access menu. \
While in the system list, press `[SELECT]` button on your controller to open the Quick Access menu, then choose **SKIP TO THE NEXT SONG**.

Audio files added in the /music folder will be played randomly.

It is also possible to use per-system folders, in order to play specific music while browsing a particular system. For this, you have to create a folder named exactly as the roms system folder (that you can find in es-systems.cfg), and put audio files in it.

NB : enabling the "ONLY PLAY SYSTEM-SPECIFIC MUSIC FOLDER" option allows RetroBat to play all songs located in a system folder (eg. /music/3do/) while browing the games available in this specific system list, but not the songs located in others subfolders.

The files that are present in /music/ will be picked up randomly for any system (whether you have system-specific songs option enabled or not).

If you disable "ONLY PLAY SYSTEM-SPECIFIC MUSIC FOLDER", RetroBat will play randomly a song in  /music/ directory and any of its sub-folders.\
