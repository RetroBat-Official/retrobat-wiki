<div align="left"><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/12l87Hk.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

## bios folder

This folder is where (with few exceptions) all system bios & firmwares will need to be placed.

More on bios files can be found in each [system individual pages](../systems-and-emulators/supported-game-systems/).

## cheats folder

This folder is used to store the cheats that some emulators can load when activating the "cheats" feature.

## decorations folder

This folder comes empty. It can be used to add bezel files to RetroBat, these bezels will be available in RetroBat in addition to the ones provided by default in the  `system\decorations` folder.

## emulationstation folder

This folder contains the main executables used for RetroBat interface and for the executable used to configure and run emulators. The structure is the following:

<div align="left"><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vAXEckR.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

{% hint style="info" %}
RetroBat configuration files (es\_systems.cfg, es\_input.cfg, ...) as well as program logs are located in this folder and its subfolders.
{% endhint %}

### .emulationstation subfolder

#### collections

Here you will find the file created by ES when you create an [editable game collection](https://wiki.retrobat.org/navigation/game-collections#editable-game-collections). This file, named as the collection created, with a `.cfg` extension, contains the differents games of the created collection, with their paths.

#### music

RetroBat allow the use of `.mp3` ,`.ogg` ,`.wav`and `.flac` audio files, and also some others less used format.\
A song can be skipped by pushing the left stick`[L3]`button, or from the Quick Access menu. \
While in the system list, press `[SELECT]` button on your controller to open the Quick Access menu, then choose **SKIP TO THE NEXT SONG**.

Audio files added in the /music folder will be played randomly.

It is also possible to use per-system folders, in order to play specific music while browsing a particular system. For this, you have to create a folder named exactly as the roms system folder (that you can find in es-systems.cfg), and put audio files in it.

NB : enabling the "ONLY PLAY SYSTEM-SPECIFIC MUSIC FOLDER" option allows RetroBat to play all songs located in a system folder (eg. /music/3do/) while browing the games available in this specific system list, but not the songs located in others subfolders.

The files that are present in /music/ will be picked up randomly for any system (whether you have system-specific songs option enabled or not).

If you disable "ONLY PLAY SYSTEM-SPECIFIC MUSIC FOLDER", RetroBat will play randomly a song in  /music/ directory and any of its sub-folders.\
