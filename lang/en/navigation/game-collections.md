# Game Collections

Game Collections are a powerful way to sort your library in a different way as the default "per system" organization.

When a Collection is created, it appears in the [System View](system-view-and-game-view.md) amongst the list of systems.

The Game Collection Settings screen is available from the Main Menu.
