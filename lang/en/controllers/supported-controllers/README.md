# Supported Controllers

All major controllers that are compatible with Windows Operating System should work with Retrobat.&#x20;

However, due to the management of controller drivers by Windows, it is recommended to use a X-Input controller for best compatibility.



The Subpages of the wiki contain information on controllers that have been tested by the team.
